#+TITLE: Differential Equations 微分方程

* Introduction

** Definition
equations containing differences
:example:
$F=m\frac{dv}{dt}$
$F=mg-kv$
kill $F$ we get $mg-kv=m\frac{dv}{dt}$
which is a differential equation
:end:

** Step
1. Construction of the Model
   :example:
   physical principles
   to
   mathematical expressions
   :end:
   1. Identify independent & dependent variables
   2. Choose the units of measurement for each variable
2. Analysis of the Model
3. Comparison with Experiment or Observation

** Type
*** Ordinary D.E.
abbre. as O.D.E
*** Partial D.E.

** Meaning 方向场的几何意义
e.g.
$\frac{dv}{dt} = 9.8 - \frac{v}{5}$
shows a *direction field* or a *slope field*
view [[file:slopefield/][this dictionary]] to generate one.

$\frac{dv}{dt} = f(t,y)$
(t,y) given point
each point t,y : short line segment : group of solution

*** two observatons
1. constructing a direction field *need not* solve equation
2. Computer or other computational or graphical aid are well suited
