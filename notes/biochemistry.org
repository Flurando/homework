The Facts of Life
** 4 levels
| proteins                                | structures              | organisms | ecosystem |
| this is the basis                       | biomolecules controlled |           |           |
| lipids and carbohydrates also important | functional purposes     |           |           |
| but not basic                           |                         |           |           |
*** energy source sunlight
** What is life?
- Organisms complicated + hightly organized
- Biological structures serve functional purposes
- Living systems are actively engaged in energy transformations
- LIving systems have a remarkable capacity for self-replication

** Biomolecules
:example:
+ Nucleotide -> DNA/RNA
+ Amino acids -> protein
+ Carbonhydrates -> sugar
+ Fatty acid -> lipid
:end:
*** they all have "direction"
*** CHON
covalent bond共价键
这几个之间的共价键能量高，更稳定
** the Structual Organization of Complex Biomolecules
:example:
Cholesterol 胆固醇
$\beta$-carotene 胡萝卜素
Chlorophyll a 叶绿素
:end:
*** they have different sizes
** Properties of some important biomolecules
*** a sense or directionality
dna/rna 5'-3'
Protein: N-terminal - C-terminal
*** Informational
*** three dimensional architecture
*** biomolecular interactions
**** weak forces
Covalent bonds -> strong force
:example:
C-C bond 343kJ/mol
:end:

weak forces 0.4-40kJ/mol => decide which of them can form bonds

** the Organization and Structure of Cells
