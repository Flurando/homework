*** 24
Refer to the points as ABC
We have $\vec{AB} = (-1,1,2)$,
and $\vec{AC} = (-3,2,3)$.
Thus we get
a normal vector of the plane
as $\vec{AB} \times \vec{AC} = (-1,-3,1)$.
ultilizing this and point A
the plane can be written as
$−1(x−2)−3(y−4)+1(z−5)=0$.
which can be simplified as $x+3y−z=9$.
*** 30
L1:
\begin{align*}
x &= t\\
y &= 3-3t\\
z &= -2-t
\end{align*}
L2:
\begin{align*}
x &= 1+s\\
y &= 4+s\\
z &= -1+s
\end{align*}
we can see they both include point $(0,3,-2)$.
then with a random $(1,0,-1)$ from L1
and $(2,5,0)$ from L2
we have a normal vector of the plane as
\begin{equation*}
(2,2,2)\times (1,-3,1) = (8,0,-8)
\end{equation*}
then we can get the plane with this and point
being $x-z+2=0,y\in \bar{R}$.

*** 36
First we observe that $(0,1,0)$ is on the line
so there is a vector between it and the desired point $(2,1,-1)$,
$(2,0,-1)$ with magnitude length of $\sqrt{5}$.
then we choose a random $(2,3,2)$,
the line can be represented by vector $(1,1,1)$ and a point $(0,1,0)$.
\begin{align}
\sin\theta &= \frac{\left | (2,0,-1) \times (1,1,1) \right |}{\sqrt{15}}\\
&= \frac{\left | (1,3,2) \right |}{\sqrt{15}}\\
&= \frac{\sqrt{14}}{\sqrt{15}}
\end{align}
so distance is $\frac{\sqrt{14}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{42}}{3}$.
*** 42
we choose $(1,0,1)$, $(2,0,0)$ and $(0,4,0)$ from the plane
getting two vectors
namely $(1,0,-1), (-1,4,1)$.
so we have a normal vector $(4,0,4)$.
now we calculate $(0,2,3)$ and $(4,0,4)$.
the latter can be seen as $(1,0,1)$,
\begin{align*}
\cos\theta &= \frac{(0,2,3) \cdot (1,0,1)}{\sqrt{26}}\\
&= \frac{3}{\sqrt{26}}
\end{align*}
so the distance is $\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}$.
*** 48
$(2,-3,-3)$ and $(1,13,18)$ are common points of the planes
giving a vector $(-1,16,21)$,
using $(0,1,1)$ we get a normal vector for the first plane
as $(5,1,-1)$.
similarly using $(-1,1,1)$ we have normal vector $(1,4,3)$.
assume $\theta$ as the angle of the two normal vectors
we have $\cos \theta = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{26}}$.
so $\theta = \arccos \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{26}}$.
this along with its supplementary angle is the answer.
*** 54
let $x=2$, we have the answer as $\left(2,-\frac{20}{7}, \frac{27}{7}\right)$.
*** 60
$(3,2,5)$ and $(1,-3,1)$ are on the line
we have
\begin{align}
x &= t\\
y &= 2.5t - 5.5\\
z &= 2t-1
\end{align}
*** 66
my answer is $x=\sqrt{3}y+C,z=3$ where C is any real number
because the plane is parallel to plane xOy
and $\frac{\pi}{6}+\frac{\pi}{3}=\frac{\pi}{2}$,
the slope k of the line is pinned at $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$.
*** 72
of course, because we can always cross multiply two vectors like this.

**** a
the volumn for $\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}-\frac{z^2}{c^2}=1$
and $z=0$ $z=h,h>0$ is $\pi abh \left(1+\frac{h^2}{3c^2}\right)$,
ultilizing the formula of ellipse area and integral.
**** b
$V=\frac{h}{2} \left(A_0+A_h\right)$.
**** c
$A_0=\pi ab$,
$A_h=\pi ab\left(1+\frac{h^2}{c^2}\right)$,
$A_m=\pi ab\left(1+\frac{h^2}{4c^2}\right)$.
combine them and they are indeed equivalent.

x is restricted to $[-1,1]$.
it is not a closed region
**** 3
$z=\frac{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+2x}}{\sqrt{2x-x^2-y^2}}$.
not a closed region
it is a region
x is $[0,2]$ and y is in $[-1,1]$.
**** 5

\begin{align}
\lim_{(x,y)\rightarrow (0,0)} \cos \frac{x^2+y^3}{x+y+1} &= \lim_{(x,y)\rightarrow (0,0)} \cos \frac{0}{1}\\
&= \cos 0\\
&= 1
\end{align}
*** 12
$\lim_{(x,y)\rightarrow \left( \frac{\pi}{2},0 \right) \frac{\cos y + 1}{y-\sin x}$.
when x, y approaches the limit, we get $\frac{2}{-1}$,
so the limit is just $-2$.
*** 18
\begin{align}
\lim_{\begin{align*}(x,y) &\rightarrow (2,2)\\x+y &\neq 4\end{align*}} \frac{x+y-4}{\sqrt{x+y}-2} &= \lim_{\begin{align*}z &\rightarrow 4\\z &\neq 4\end{align*}} \frac{z-4}{\sqrt{z}-2}\\
&= \lim_{z\rightarrow 4} \left(\sqrt{z}+2\right)\\
&= 4
\end{align}
*** 24
rewrite the fractions to find the limits
\begin{align}
\lim_{(x,y)\rightarrow (2,2)} \frac{x-y}{x^4-y^4} &= \lim_{(x,y)\rightarrow (2,2)} \frac{1}{(x+y)(x^2+y^2)}\\
&= \frac{1}{32}
\end{align}
*** 30
since it is continued at the point, we can just assign the values
\begin{equation}
\lim_{P\rightarrow (2,-3,6)} \ln\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2} = \ln 7
\end{equation}
*** 42
To find out at what points $(x, y, z)$ in space are the function continuous,
**** a
\begin{equation}
f(x,y,z) = \ln xyz
\end{equation}
all positive, all negative, or two/one positive or negative would be ok.
**** b
\begin{equation}
f(x,y,z) = e^{x+y} \cos z
\end{equation}
It don't impose any restriction as long as x,y,z are real numbers
*** 48
# By considering different paths of approach, show that the functions inhave no limit as (x, y)->(0, 0).
\begin{equation}
h(x,y) = \frac{x^2 y}{x^4+y^2}
\end{equation}
using $y=x^2$, the limit is $\frac{1}{2}$.
using $y=kx$, the limit is $0$.
since they are different, the limit doesn't exist.
*** 54
# if f(x_0,y_0)=3, what can you say about \lim_{(x,y)\rightarrow (x_0,y_0)} f(x,y) if f is continuous at (x_0,y_0)? or if f is not continous there? Give your reasons. Hint: The Sandwich Theory.
when it is continuous there, the limit is $3$ of course.
when it is not continuous there, the limit may or may not exist
and when it does exist, it might or might not be $3$.
*** 60
\begin{equation}
f(x,y) = xy\frac{x^2-y^2}{x^2+y^2}
\end{equation}
the function approaches $0$ when $(x,y)\rightarrow (0,0)$.
so $f(0,0)$ can be defined as 0 for it to be continuous at the origin.
*** 66
\begin{equation}
f(x,y) = \frac{x^2-y^2}{x^2+y^2}
\end{equation}
# find the limit as $(x,y)\rightarrow (0,0)$ or show that it doesn't exist.
it doesn't exist
because the limit is 1 when we approach the origin through x-axis
and becomes -1 when we go along y-axis
they are different which is impossible
*** 72
# use the limit definition to find a delta for any given epsilon
\begin{equation}
f(x,y) = \frac{x+y}{2+\cos x}, \epsilon = 0.02
\end{equation}
when x is near 0, we know that $2<2+\cos x<3$.
then choosing $\delta = 0.02$ is sufficient.
*** 78
# similar to the one above, just become xyz instead
\begin{equation}
f(x,y,z) = \tan^2 x + \tan^2 y + \tan^2 z, \epsilon = 0.03
\end{equation}
the tangent stuff is smaller than $x^2+y^2+z^2$,
which is further smaller than $\delta^2$.
so we can choose $\delta = 0.1$.
actually as long as $\delta^2 < \epsilon$, we are fine.
