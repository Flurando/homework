the code to draw this is

  #!/usr/bin/env sh
  exec guile -L ../../../../../notes/slopefield/ -x .w --language=wisp --no-auto-compile -s "$0" "$@"
  !#

  use-modules : slopefield

  define : square x
    * x x
  
  define : dy/dx x y
    * y : square : - y 2

  ;; by default, x-min=y-min=-8
  ;; x-max=y-max=8
  ;; x-scl=y-scl=1
  ;; distance=0.4

  ;; write-data <the function dy/dx> (optional arguments in order: x-min x-max y-min y-max x-scl y-scl
  ;; distance)
  write-data dy/dx -16 8

we can see that it does depends on $y$ at $t=0$,
if then $y_{t=0}=2,\quad 0$, we know $y$ would not change
else when $y_{t=0}\in (2,\quad 0)$, $y$ will appoach to $2$
at last, when $y_{t=0}<0$, y would become negative infinity
and when $y_{t=0}>2$, y would become positive infinity

** 15
we can see at $y=3, 0$, there are sharp changes
so $e$ or $h$
from the picture, we know $y' < 0$ when $y<0$
so it is $h$

** 20
we assume $y$ as the amount of drug present
and $t$ as time passed
for $t$, the patient gets $0.5g/h$  inside but have a consumption rate of 40% every hour
so $\frac{dy}{dt} = 0.5 - 0.4y$
after a really long time, it must come to a static level
where the consumptioned equals to breathed
which means $0.4y=0.5$, giving $y=1.25$ which means $1.25g$

y does not have dependence on $y_{t=0}$ because the whole field is "rotating"

$$\frac{dy}{dt} = -ay+b$$
$$e^{at}\frac{dy}{dt} = (-ay+b)e^{at}$$
$$e^{at}\frac{dy}{dt}+ae^{at}y = be^{at}$$
$$\frac{d(e^{at}y)}{dt} = be^{at}$$
$$e^{at}y = \frac{b}{a} e^{at} + C$$
$$y = \frac{b}{a} + Ce^{-at}$$
sorry for the absense of sketch but I don't have a sketch pad configured here
and it is extremelly complicated for me to transfer a photo on phone to the computer
after $a$ increases, the solution start line goes down, and the whole picture becomes flatter
after $b$ increases, the solution start line goes up
after bothe $a,b$ increase with a constant ratio, the whole picture is flattened

** 6
$$\frac{dy}{dt} = -ay$$
$$\frac{dy}{dt} + ay = 0$$
$$e^{at}\frac{dy}{dt} + ae^{at} y = 0$$
$$\frac{de^{at}y}{dt} = 0$$
$$e^{at}y=C$$
$$y=Ce^{-at}$$
suppose $y=C_0+Ce^{-at}$
$$-aC^{-at} = -aC_0 -aC^{-at} +b$$
$$C_0=\frac{b}{a}$$
so $y=\frac{b}{a}+Ce^{-at}$

** 9
unsure what $a$ is about
$$245\frac{dv}{dt} = 49^2-v^2$$
$$\frac{245dv}{(49+v)dt} = 49-v$$
$$\frac{245d\ln(49+v)}{dt}+(49+v) = 98$$
suppose $w=\ln(49+v)$
$$\frac{245dw}{dt}+e^w=98$$
$$\frac{245dw}{dt}=-e^w+98$$
$$\frac{dw}{98-e^w}=\frac{dt}{245}$$
$$-\ln |98-e^w|+C_1 = \frac{t}{245}+C_2$$
$$\ln |98-e^w| = -\frac{t}{245}+C$$
$$98-e^w = \pm e^{-\frac{t}{245}+C}$$
$$v=49\pm e^{-\frac{t}{245}+C}$$

here taking the initial direction as positive direction
since $49\pm e^C=0$
we know $v=49-e^{-\frac{t}{245}+2\ln7}$
it is plotted like
#+begin_src gnuplot :file images/9.3-9/output.png :exports both
  set term png size 300,300
  set xrange [0:600]
  set yrange [0:50]
  set xlabel "X"
  set ylabel "Y"
  set notitle

  f(x) = 49-exp(2*log(7)-x/245)

  plot f(x) title "v"
#+end_src

don't understand what these two drag forces mean, making the curve instead of a line?
in that way, we need $x=\int_0^t v dt$
so $x=49t+245e^{-\frac{t}{245}+2\ln7}$
now $300=49t+245e^{-\frac{t}{245}+2\ln7}$
so $\frac{300}{49}=t+245e^{-\frac{t}{245}}$
let $f=\frac{t}{245}$
we have $\frac{60}{49^2}=f+e^{-f}$
so $f<0$, impossible. can't solve this.

** 12
$$\frac{du}{dt} = -ku +kT$$
using the universal solution we got earlier,
$$u=T+Ce^{-kt}$$
since $T+C=u_0$, we have $C=u_0-T$
so $u=T+(u_0-T)e^{-kt}$
$$2e^{-k\rho} = 1$$
